1. **Basic Proficiency (1-2 weeks)**

    - **Learning Basic Commands:** Understand commands like `git init`,
      `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git status`, and
      `git log`.
    - **Basic Workflow:** Manage simple tasks such as creating branches,
      merging, and resolving conflicts.

2. **Intermediate Skills (1-3 months)**

      branch strategies, and merging techniques.
    - **Rebasing:** Learn to use `git rebase` for a cleaner commit history.
    - **Remote Repositories:** Understand how to work with multiple remote
      repositories, set up remotes, and handle collaboration.

3. **Advanced Proficiency (3-6 months)**

    - **Stashing and Cherry-Picking:** Use `git stash` to temporarily save
      changes, and `git cherry-pick` to apply specific commits from other
      branches.
    - **Advanced History Manipulation:** Master commands like `git rebase`,
      `git revert`, and `git reset` for complex history editing.
    - **Hooks and Automation:** Use Git hooks for automation and integration
      with CI/CD pipelines.

4. **Expert Level (6 months - several years)**

    - **Git Internals:** Understand Git's underlying data structures and how
      it works under the hood.
    - **Complex Workflows:** Design and manage complex branching and merging
      workflows.
    - **Performance Tuning:** Optimize Git performance for large repositories
      and handle complex scenarios involving Git's lower-level commands and
      settings.
